		<h1>Erica Corder</h1>

		<p>All-in-one digital media specialist.</p>

		<p>As a child growing up in Mississippi, I'd write mostly fiction and overly-dramatic autobiography in ten-cent, spiral-bound notebooks. These days, my non-fiction, news coverage enjoys a wider audience and is a little more diverse, spanning the following formats:</p>

		<ul>Writing</ul>
		<ul>Reporting</ul>
		<ul>Editing</ul>
		<ul>Photography</ul>
		<ul>Videography</ul>
		<ul>Social media</ul>
